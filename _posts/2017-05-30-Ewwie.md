## To Do - Old##

* Move/organize stones around shower area
* Design and build frame and door for workshop
* Research standalone ice maker
* Get 4 more 5-gallon gas cans - need one extra to mix special fuel for the generator in
* Get extra 5 gallon water jugs
* Build a PVC rack for the water jugs
* Research pricing on sandbags
* Find new storm shutter company
* Find cheap source of neoprene
* Buy an air conditioner

I've decided that our hurricane shelter needs to support us staying in it for 8-12 hours: doors closed, locked up tight and *no air conditioning*.  I need more plans.

## Temperature Sensor##

Well that temperature sensor came today but it was DOA, so I get to replace it now. That delays things a bit.

## Air Conditioner##

So it occurs to me that if we need weather out a hurricane in our shelter we won't be able to have the air conditioner in the window. 8-12 hours in the shelter with no air conditioning could get bad: we need something that will cool us that doesn't need an exhaust. A [5-gallon bucket air conditioner](http://www.instructables.com/id/5-Gallon-Bucket-Air-Conditioner/) should give us some relief at the cost of pouring out the water and replacing the ice every few hours. It's better than nothing...

## Bathroom##

Here's the ewwie portion of this shelter plan: going to the bathroom. If that door needs to be able to stay closed for 8-12 hours, then we need a bathroom in the shelter. Basically, that means shitting in a bucket in the corner.

I was gone for this week but the garden survived!

## Garden Log##

#### Container 1

![Container 1 Progress]({{site.basepath}}/img/IMG_20170710_082055242.jpg)

It's worth noting that this container seems to have something wrong with its weed cloth. Whenever the water runs out it's brown - full of dirt it looks like. I'm assuming it won't be a problem before we take that container apart and plant something new in it.

* Bush beans - Still doing well, still making plenty of beans. The research I've done says I should be picking the beans 50-55 days after the plant started. 
* Flowers - Even better than before.
* Ginger - No change, still healthy

#### Container 2

The eggplant exploded while I was gone! It has huge leaves now and is starting to flower:

#### Container 3

This container is currently shaded. 

* Parsley - It's growing new leaves now that it's had a week away from the wild parsley-eating girl. It also has fewer yellow leaves. Still, I had hoped this would take off like a weed and it's not :(
* Big pepper plant - There's no major change in the stress level of the plant but it's certainly having an effect on the peppers. The farthest along pepper is already turning yellow on the vine *way* before it's reached a useful size and the other peppers are looking deformed and they have an odd scaly texture on them:

My research has turned up several potential problems:
	* Bad fertilizer mix
	* Lack of light during pollenation
	* Bacterial leaf spot
	
Bad fertilizer mix is a possibility - I used a standard 10-10-10 fertilizer for each container which may be the wrong mix for peppers. Lack of light during pollenation is a definite possibility with the shade, but we're in the hottest part of the summer now and I'm not sure I dare remove the shade even to test how it affects the health of the plant. After a bit of eyeballing, it doesn't look like bacterial leaf spot because the spots don't turn dark purple and look rotten. Overall, I think I'm going to blame the shade. I'll have to find a better way to shade the peppers.

* Turmeric - We have three turmeric shoots now!

## Plan ##

#### Container 1

I'm beginning to wonder if I should remove one of the flowers so that the bush beans can have some more reoom.

#### Container 2

All's well so far, so I'm going to let this ride in terms of watering and shading for the time being.

#### Container 3

I need to investigate better ways to protect the peppers from the sun while ensuring the plant gets enough light.

#### Container 4 - Planned

Possible options:

* Yellow squash 
* Cherry tomatoes
* Okra
* Southern Peas
* Sweet potatoes

I'm leaning toward cherry tomatoes at the moment.

#### Fall/Winter

We'd like the following plants:

* Garlic
* Onion
* Green onion
* Spinach
* Kale
* More greens
* Carrots
* Broccoli

I'd like at least 6 containers by October 1st. 

#### Fruit Trees

We want the following fruit trees:

* Avocado
* Mango
* Lime
* Papaya

Nullsoft Scriptable Installer Service is a tool you can use to generate installers. It's farily popular - you've probably used an installer generated by it - the 
one I can think of first would be WinAmp, but I don't think anyone has installed WinAmp since 2003, so it's not a good example.

I downloaded the NSIS installer from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/latest/download?source=typ_redirect). I downloaded the most recent version which is 3.03.

My goal here is to create a graphical installer which will encapsulate all of the files which are part of a Py2Exe-generated Python Executable and install them to a folder in the root of the C: drive on a PC. 

## Installation Steps ##

1. Double click the installer to start it.
2. On the first screen, click 'Next':
![Initial install screen]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 09_44_30-NSIS 3.03 Setup.png)
3. Click 'I agree' on the next screen:
![License screen]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 09_54_33-NSIS 3.03 Setup.png)
4. The 'Full' install is the default and is acceptable. Click 'Next':
![Install selection screen]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 09_55_17-NSIS 3.03 Setup.png)
5. The default installation path is acceptable. Click 'Install':
![Install path screen]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 09_56_11-NSIS 3.03 Setup.png)
6. The installation will proceed:
![Installation]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 09_57_20-NSIS 3.03 Setup.png)
7. When finished you will be presented with a new screen. I de-selected viewing the release notes and left starting NSIS selected, then clicked 'Finish':
![Final install screen]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 09_58_15-NSIS 3.03 Setup.png)

## Creating an Installer ##

This is the screen presented to you when you start NSIS.:
![Initial NSIS screen]({{site.basepath}}/img/2018-05-16 10_04_10-NSIS Menu.png)

Turns out that the basis of an NSIS installer is a script. Just a plan ol' text file.

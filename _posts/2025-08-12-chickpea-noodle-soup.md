# Introduction #
This is a simple soup that is quick to put together and well-loved by the family.

If you fancy a non-vegan recipe, you can substitute chicken stock for the vegetable stock.

# Materials #

Cutting Board

Large Pot

Everyday Pan

Large, coverable bowl for storage

Wooden Spoon

# Ingredients #

1 large onion

4 Large carrots, chopped

2 celery ribs, chipped

3 tablespoons minced garlic

8 ounces pasta of some sort

Fresh chopped parsely

## Pantry ##

1 tbsp olive oil

8 cups vegetable broth

## Dry Spices ##

1 teaspoon salt

1 teaspoon dried thyme

1/2 teaspoon black pepper

# Steps #

## Lane 1  - Pasta ##

Fill a pot with a sufficient amount of water to boil the pasta and set it to heat. Once it comes to a boil and add the pasta, cooking for the recommended amount of time. Once the pasta is cooked, strain it and rinse it and set aside.

For tastier pasta, you can add vegetable broth to the water, but you will need extra broth for the soup.

## Lane 2 - Soup ##

Chop up the celery, onion and carrot. 

Put your pot or pan over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add the olive oil to the pan.

Once the oil is hot, add the celery, onions and carrots. Stir to cover with olive oil and then season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened, 5-7 minutes. Then, reduce heat to medium and git the pan a second to cool down before adding in the garlic and thyme. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.

Once finished cooking, add the vegetable stock, set the heat to high and bring it to a boil. Once it is boiling, reduce heat to minimum and simmer. The soup will be ready to eat in 15 minutes but a longer simmer is always better. Taste and add salt and pepper to your preference, and add vegetable stock to your desired consistency.

## Serving ##

Once the simmer is complete, the soup can be served. Add the pasta to the individual bowls when served and top with parsely.

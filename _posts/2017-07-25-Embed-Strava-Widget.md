I run. I run for fun. I run for fun in the sun. I really dont have a choice about that last one considering I live in Florida, but running is my preferred method of cardio exercise - despite the heat and humidity here. 

I track my runs with an app called [Strava](http://strava.com). It keeps track of my routes, charts my progress, tracks my personal bests, lets me share my runs with my wife, etc. Recently, I feel like showing off and/or receiving social shame for missing runs, so I want to embed a Strava widget onto this site. This post will help me organize the resources I find and the steps I take to do that.

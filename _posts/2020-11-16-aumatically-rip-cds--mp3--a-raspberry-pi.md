title: How to Automatically Rip CDs to MP3 with a Raspberry Pi

## Introduction ##

My wife has a huge, sorry, YUGE collection of CDs. She'd rather they're all MP3s or some other digital format for
easier listening. 

I was doing this on my PC, but it's cumbersome and rather manual. I have a vision that I should be able to attach
my USB CD drive to my Raspberry Pi and have the ripper automatically start when I insert a CD, then eject when it's
done. With such an approach, I could get through this task much more quickly.

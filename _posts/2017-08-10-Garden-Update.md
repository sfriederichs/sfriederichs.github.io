Little movement in the garden this week - summer heat is killer.

## Garden Log ##

#### Container 1

![Container 1 Progress]({{site.basepath}}/img/IMG_20170802_092732091.jpg)

It's worth noting that this container seems to have something wrong with its weed cloth. Whenever the water runs out it's brown - full of dirt it looks like. I'm assuming it won't be a problem before we take that container apart and plant something new in it.

Also, this container seems to have a low soil level. I guess I didn't put enough in when I made it.

* Bush beans - I have to pick a lot of bad leaves off of these beans, but they're hanging in there. Let's hope they stick around until fall.
* Flowers - I tore out the white flowers which were closest to the bush beans to give them more room. They're doing well in their new home and the beans have a little more space.
* Ginger - It actually looks a bit better than it has been: there's some new greenish growth I think

#### Container 2

The eggplant is looking a bit eaten up and wind-damaged, but it's flowering which is a good sign:

I picked as many of the bugs off as I could find and I haven't seen any of them in a while. There isn't a lot of leaf growth but I assume it's putting is energy into making flowers.

Regardless, I'm going to find a nice spray I can make to get rid of the bugs.

#### Container 3

This container is currently shaded. 

This container also had a bout of mushroom growth which seems to have been fueled by excess rain. A few days of sun has cleared up the worst of it. I'll keep an eye on it though.



* Parsley - Showing some signs of yellowing. Heat? Mushrooms? Too much shade?

* Big pepper plant - The pepper plant does not seem stressed: the leaves are maybe a bit curly, but no yellowing and it's showing new growth from the stem. Overall I'm optimistic about it

* Poblano sprouts - We diced up a poblano for guacamole and I figured, why not try to sprout the seeds? So I did:

It's turning out rather well, so I planted a few of the sprouts into the same container as the pepper plant. I'm told the two kinds will cross-pollenate which could produce some interesting hybrids!
* Green Pepper sprouts - Okay last week I said that I was closing this chapter out, but as I was planting the poblano sprouts I found that plenty of the green pepper seeds had sprouted and were making root systems, but no green shoots growing up. No idea why, but I guess I'll have to keep an eye on them for a while longer.
* Turmeric - Still big, still healthy.

#### Green Onions

We've been cutting up green onions, so I decided to sprout some:

![Green onion sprouts]({{site.basepath}}/img/IMG_20170807_075159123.jpg)

I just planted the sprouts outside in an out-of-the-way place where they won't get direct sunlight most of the day, so we'll see what happens. There's always more green onions to sprout if they don't make it.

## Fruit Trees ##

### Papaya ###

It's growing, but the heat and lack of rain recently is getting to it. There's some yellowing on the leaves, but no signs of it dying on me. 

### Avocado ###

Still no movement on the sprouting. I'm told this takes forever but forever is really a long time...

## Plan ##

#### Container 1

Remove the other flower come fall and probably refit the whole thing and replant the beans. Maybe get more beans?

#### Container 2

Patience: the eggplants will come. Or not. My friend says his aren't producing much either.
Regardless, I need to research some sprays to counteract the bugs.

#### Container 3

This container definitely needs some drainage updates, but with how full it is I'm not sure how I can affect them without killing everything in it.

#### Containers 4-6 - Planned for Fall

Possible options:

* Garlic
* Onion
* Green onion
* Spinach
* Kale
* More greens
* Carrots
* Broccoli

#### Fruit Trees

We want the following fruit trees:

* Avocado
* Mango
* Lime

#### Summer Crops to Plant

It's getting to be fall time and too late for summer crops, so I'm 

* Yellow squash 
* Cherry tomatoes
* Okra
* Southern Peas
* Sweet potatoes
* Peppers
* Eggplant

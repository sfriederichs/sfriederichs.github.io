Just seeing how easy it is to add a new post. Realistically anyway. Now this post serves as my place to put reminders and notes for how to make posts, format markdown, etc.

I never trust how difficult things may seem. They're probably twice
as difficult as I imagine them. If writing a post is this easy....

Oh look, it's not!

It didn't show up in the posts. 

Okay, I figured it out. If the date in the 'date:' entry up there isn't the same as the date in the file name of the page, it doesn't work.

And make sure you have a '.md' extension on the file.

#Hey, did you know?#

If you don't put a space before the first letter in a title after the '#' in a heading, Jekyll doesn't format it correctly?

# This is right#

See? Add a space.

# Titles#
Titles are separate from headers - titles are in the front matter. If you have too many posts with the same title they dont' show up right. You should fix that.

# Links#

Links look like [this](http://google.com). The text goes in the brackets, the link URL goes in the parenthesis. 

# Responsive Images#

Apparently this is an important thing. All I know is the image tag is pretty static and I need some magic happening there.

I can't even gem install the thing yet.

# Inserting Hash Characters #

So obviously, the hash character (&#35) is used for section titles, so how do you put one into tricky places? You have to use HTML entity for the hash: & # 35 - but with no spaces

Yeah... That doesn't work very well. I have a few other ways to do this. Here's a failed attempt at putting a hash character first in a quoted section:
> # *.h = svn:keywords=Author Date Id Rev URL;svn:eol-style=native  

See? It treats the leading hash as a heading marker instead of as a hash. So, add a backslash before it like this:

> \#*.h = svn:keywords=Author Date Id Rev URL;svn:eol-style=native  

# Fixing Newlines in Quoted Sections #

Quoted sections look like this:

> Line 1
> Line 2
> Line 3

Oops - that doesn't look right, does it? That should be three different lines, but it's not. The reason for that is that there aren't enough spaces at the end of the lines.  If you add two spaces before you hit return then you get this:

> Line 1  
> Line 2  
> Line 3  

Ta-da.

And, sometimes quoted sections gobble up non-quoted sections:

> This is the quoted section
And this shouldn't be, but is.

So, add a blank line after the quoted section:

> This is the quoted section

And this actually isn't anymore.


# Fixing *'s in Quoted Sections #

I've had a situation with quoted text where I'm trying to express a file filter that encompasses all files (\*.\*) instead being evaluated as putting emphasis on the '.' (*.*). It probably also happens with non-quoted text too but I haven't checked. To fix this, escape the *'s with backslashes.

# Fixing Indentation in Quoted (Code) Sections #

If you try to write code with indents in quoted sections, the leading whitespace is gone:

> This has no leading whitespace  
>	This has a tab character   
>    This has four spaces  
> And all of them look the same  
> - An awful haiku  

To fix this, don't use quoted sections for code. Use highlighted sections:
> \{\% highlight python \%\}  
> Put code here!  
> \{\% endhighlight \%\}  

and replace 'python' with whatever your language is. I don't know what the valid languages are, so just try!

Just kidding, here's a few valid languages:

* python
* ruby
* dot - Graphviz markup

Note: there are excessive backslashes in there, but if I don't put them there then Jekyll chokes. Ignore/remove the backslashes.

# Centering Images #

I still haven't done this, but [here's](https://stackoverflow.com/q/255170) a stackoverflow link that discusses many options.

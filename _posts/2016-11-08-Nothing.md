Just seeing how easy it is to add a new post. Realistically anyway. Now this post serves as my place to put reminders and notes for how to make posts, format markdown, etc.

I never trust how difficult things may seem. They're probably twice
as difficult as I imagine them. If writing a post is this easy....

Oh look, it's not!

It didn't show up in the posts. 

Okay, I figured it out. If the date in the 'date:' entry up there isn't the same as the date in the file name of the page, it doesn't work.

And make sure you have a '.md' extension on the file.

#Hey, did you know?#

If you don't put a space before the first letter in a title after the '#' in a heading, Jekyll doesn't format it correctly?

# This is right#

See? Add a space.

# Titles#
Titles are separate from headers - titles are in the front matter. If you have too many posts with the same title they dont' show up right. You should fix that.

# Links#

Links look like [this](http://google.com). The text goes in the brackets, the link URL goes in the parenthesis. 

#Responsive Images#

Apparently this is an important thing. All I know is the image tag is pretty static and I need some magic happening there.

I can't even gem install the thing yet.

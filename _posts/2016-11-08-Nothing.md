Just seeing how easy it is to add a new post. Realistically anyway.

I never trust how difficult things may seem. They're probably twice
as difficult as I imagine them. If writing a post is this easy....


Oh look, it's not!

It didn't show up in the posts. 

Okay, I figured it out. If the date in the 'date:' entry up there isn't the same as the date in the file name of the page, it doesn't work.

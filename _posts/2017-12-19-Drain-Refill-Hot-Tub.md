Our hot tub is icky and the guy who usually cleans and drains it will not be able to get to us before it freezes. He says we can do it ourselves if we're smart and we do some research. I can't help whether I'm smart or not, but here's the research.

## Materials ##
* [Hot Tub Line Flush](http://amzn.to/2Bfo9xX)
* Baking soda
* Garden hose (or two)
* Simple Green
* Vinegar
* [Spa Up (pH Increaser)](http://amzn.to/2D7TdNJ)
* [Spa Down (pH Decreaser)] (http://amzn.to/2D3G3Bf)
* [Hot Tub Water Test Strips](http://amzn.to/2CGREF5)

## Steps ##

1. Add a line flush product to the existing water and let it flush out the lines for 20 minutes to 4 hours before the drain.
2. When the line flush is finished, turn off power to the hot tub. For me, this is done at the breakers
9. Remove filter cover, then remove filter cartridges
3. Locate the drain valve on the front/lower plastic pan. Hold the larger (rear) body to prevent it from turning, then loosen and remove the front cap to expose the underlying male hose threads.
4. Attach a garden hose to the exposed threads and put the other end of the hose where you want the water to go. Hint: water flows downhill
5. Gently rotate the larger (rear) valve body 1/3 turn counterclockwise to unlock the drain valve.
6. Pull the larger (rear) body outward to open drain
7. After the spa drains, perform steps 2-5 in reverse order to close the drain prior to refilling the spa.
8. Clear all debris from the spa (i.e., clean it up). You must use a non-abrasive and non-sudsing cleaner. Baking soda can be used to remove tough deposits on the hot tub. A diluted 50/50 vinegar/water mix can be used to clean deposits as well, and so can SimpleGreen. 
9. Rinse off the hot tub and pump the water out manually (or just a shop vac).
10. Place the end of your garden hose into the empty filter bucket.
11. Fill until water covers all jets but does not touch the bottom of the lowest headrest. (DO NOT OVERFILL!)
12 Turn on power to spa at the circuit breaker to start boot up sequence. The heater and filter pump will automatically activate after several seconds. If the control panel LED flashes water temperature and “COL” or “ICE” this is normal. 
13. Lower the thermostat to the minimum temperature.
13. Turn on jets pump(s) to ensure proper mixing when adding start-up chemicals.
14. Superchlorinate (Brominate?)
15. Adjust total alkalinity and pH
16. Adjust calcium hardness

Add the spa water chemicals as recommended by your authorized Jacuzzi dealer
leave cover open for at least 20 minutes when adding chemicals
add one chemical at a time and then retest until all readings are in line

## Spa Water Adjustment Rules ##

### pH and Total Alkalinity (TA) ###

#### Low pH, Normal TA ####
Add a pH increaser that will not impact the TA. This will ensure that your pH levels rise while not impacting the overall TA levels.

#### Low pH, High TA #### 
First, add a pH decreaser to lower the TA levels. Once that is in the correct range, use an increaser that won’t impact the TA levels to raise the pH to normal.

#### Low pH and TA #### 
Add a pH increaser to raise both the TA and pH levels. Retest the water to make sure both have been brought into normal rane.

#### High pH and TA #### 
If both levels are too high, add a pH decreaser to the water to bring both the levels down. Retest the water to make sure both the TA and pH are in normal range.

#### Normal pH, High TA #### 
Add a pH decreaser to lower the overall TA levels. Once these are in normal range, test your pH. If your pH levels have dropped below normal, use an increaser that won’t affect the TA levels.

#### Normal pH, Low TA #### 
Add an alkalinity increaser to raise the overall TA levels. In most cases, the overall pH levels will not be affected.

#### High pH, Normal TA #### 
Add a pH decreaser to lower the pH to a normal range. If the TA levels drop add an alkalinity increaser to bring the overall TA levels back into normal range.

#### High pH, Low TA #### 
First, add a pH decreaser to lower the pH levels, then add an alkalinity increaser to raise the TA levels. This won’t affect the overall pH level.

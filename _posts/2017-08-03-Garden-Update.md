I had a bit of a busy week so this update is late, but there's plenty to talk about.

We had a wind storm this week, so a few things got blown around. No major damage.

## Garden Log ##

#### Container 1

It's worth noting that this container seems to have something wrong with its weed cloth. Whenever the water runs out it's brown - full of dirt it looks like. I'm assuming it won't be a problem before we take that container apart and plant something new in it.

* Bush beans - Sadly all of the beans rotted off, but the plant itself is doing well. Maybe it will survive until the fall and it can really start producing for us.
* Flowers - I tore out the white flowers which were closest to the bush beans to give them more room. They're doing well in their new home and the beans have a little more space.
* Ginger - Still somewhat pathetic.

#### Container 2

The eggplant is producing new flowers - two of them right now. I took off some of the low-hanging, holey leaves. It's still growing well, but some beetles have started to become attracted to it:

Apparently they bite into the plant and suck out the sap, which makes the leaves look like this:

I pick them off when I find them and the plant isn't horribly hurt by them so far.

#### Container 3

This container is currently shaded. 

This container also had a bout of mushroom growth:

It seemed to have been fueled by excess rain and a few days of sun has apparently cleared it up. I'll keep an eye on it though. I don't know when I can get this container apart to add some drainage to it.

* Parsley - Making steady progress I suppose.

* Big pepper plant - We had a harvest event - seven peppers which were ripening. Sadly, they also had some damage on them (pictures are below). The only reason I was keeping most of the branches on the pepper plant was to support the peppers, so I gave the pepper plant a serious haircut:

The remaining leaves are under the shade and hopefully will do nicely. There were some blooms but I haven't seen if they've developed into peppers yet.
* Pepper sprouts - None have sprouted. Closing this chapter out.
* Turmeric - Still big, still healthy.


## Fruit Trees ##

### Papaya ###

Still alive, growing some I think?

### Avocado ###

No major movement on the avocado pits sprouting. I'm told it takes a *long* time though, so I'm changing the water every so often and keeping an eye on them.

## Plan ##

#### Container 1

Potentially remove the other flower come fall.

#### Container 2

Patience: the eggplants will come.

#### Container 3

I'm sprouting some poblano seeds that I might plant in here: the peppers should cross-pollenate and make some interesting peppers...

#### Container 4 - Planned

Possible options:

* Yellow squash 
* Cherry tomatoes
* Okra
* Southern Peas
* Sweet potatoes

I'm leaning toward cherry tomatoes at the moment.

#### Fall/Winter

We'd like the following plants:

* Garlic
* Onion
* Green onion
* Spinach
* Kale
* More greens
* Carrots
* Broccoli

I'd like at least 6 containers by October 1st. 

#### Fruit Trees

We want the following fruit trees:

* Avocado
* Mango
* Lime

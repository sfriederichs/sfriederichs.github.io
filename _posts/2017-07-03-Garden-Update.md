Nothing much to report this week - things just keep growing.

## Garden Log##

#### Container 1

It's worth noting that this container seems to have something wrong with its weed cloth. Whenever the water runs out it's brown - full of dirt it looks like. I'm assuming it won't be a problem before we take that container apart and plant something new in it.

* Bush beans - They're making plenty of beans, but it occurs to me that unless something changes radically this one plant will never make enough beans for one meal for three people. Oh well. Maybe another time of year or more bean plants will do the trick. 
* Flowers - They huge now. Growing great.
* Ginger - No complaints here. At some point I'm going to have to check out how the roots are doing.

#### Container 2

The eggplant is growing nicely and is sprouting new leaves. I've been watering it for the last week to give the roots time to grow into the wet soil.

#### Container 3

This container is currently shaded. 

* Parsley - The parsley is showing some yellow leaves and a certain grabby little girl keeps picking leaves off of it and eating them. All in all it's not doing as well as I'd hoped. I'll have to read up more on parsley.
* Big pepper plant - There's about a dozen peppers on the plant right now, but overall the plant looks a little stressed. The holes in the leaves don't look to be getting any worse, but most of the leaves look tired and curled. I'm reconsidering the shade, but I know that if I take it off the sun will destroy the peppers on the plant. I've been watering it a bit too but it doesn't look like it helped. I picked the worst of the leaves off the plant yesterday.
* Turmeric - I planted some turmeric in this container and have been watering it every day. No shoots coming up yet, but we'll see what happens when we get back from vacation.

## Plan ##

#### Container 1

The preliminary research I've done on beans says that when you harvest them determines their use: get them sooner rather than later and you can cook them like regular green beans. Wait too long and they turn into hard beans you have to soak for a while before you can use. I need more information on this so I can determine what to do with the beans.

#### Container 2

Monitor the eggplant for any signs of insect activity or excess sun. Consider a shade.

#### Container 3

Sadly, I think I have to prepare for the death of this pepper plant. I'd prefer to refit this container like I did with #2 prior to reusing it. I think I'll consider regrowing pepper plants from the seeds of the peppers on this one.

#### Container 4 - Planned

Possible options:

* Yellow squash 
* Cherry tomatoes
* Okra
* Southern Peas
* Sweet potatoes

I'm leaning toward cherry tomatoes at the moment.

#### Fall/Winter

We'd like the following plants:

* Garlic
* Onion
* Green onion
* Spinach
* Kale
* More greens
* Carrots
* Broccoli

I'd like at least 6 containers by October 1st. 

#### Fruit Trees

We want the following fruit trees:

* Avocado
* Mango
* Lime
* Papaya

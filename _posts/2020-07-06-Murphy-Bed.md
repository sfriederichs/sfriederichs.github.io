## Introduction ##

We have a guest room on our first floor that just doesn't get used much. There's a queen bed in there that is pretty much just taking up space most of the time. We'd like to install a [Murphy Bed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy_bed) so that we can reclaim the floor space the bed uses and possibly make the room a play room or office of some sort.

## Requirements ##

I'd like a whole-wall unit that can replace the dressers too. 

I'd love pull-out nightstands.

I have skylights now, so I need skylight blinds. For several reasons:
* In my bedroom, to block out the sun
* In the living room, to block out the heat from the sun

The living room currently has no shades, the bedroom has manual shades and the master bath (which I can see from the bedroom) has no shades at all.

I need motorized blinds everywhere. I need blackout blinds in the master bedroom and bath. I need heat-filtering in the living room (which still allow light in).

I got a quote for $5500 to install these things. I'd rather not. So I'm investigating installing them myself.

Our current skylight brand is graber. They make motorized ones. But you have to go through a dealer to get them.

## Measurements ##

### How to Measure ###

All measurements are Width (W) by Height (H) (WxH)
Measure to the nearest 1/8. If you have a 1/16th measurement, round down.

Always measure each window individually. Do not assume 'identical' windows have identical measurements.

Take three measurements of width and height: each edge and middle. 

**Choose the narrowest measurement of the three**

### Living Room 1 (Right) ###

1' 7" W x 5' 7" 1/8 L

### Living Room 2 (Left) ###

1' 7" W x 5' 7" 1/8

### Bedroom 1 (Right) ###

1' 7" 1/4 W + 5' 7"

### Bedroom 2 (Left) ###

1' 7" 1/4 W x 5' 7" 1/8

### Master Bath ###

2' 6" 1/8 W + 2' 6" 1/8 H

## What I Did ##

### Ordering ###

I ordered from BlindsGalore.com. I got the NEO smart hub and two remotes as well as the blinds described above. I placed my order on 9/8/18 and received it on 9/24/18. 

### Arrival and Inspection ###

It came as three packages - each specified which blinds were part of the package, but I later found out that was erroneous: the blind parts were
all over the place. Long rails were in one box, motors split between several, etc. 

You need to open all boxes and do an inventory of parts to make sure you have everything. I didn't do one, but everything was there.

### Preparation ###

I needed a 10ft ladder to install the blinds. I borrowed it from a neighbor. 

The order didn't ship with all of the hardware I needed to install the blinds:
I required self-tapping screws to secure the side pieces. I used 1" #8 self-tapping screws with a 1/4" hex head. 

Each motor comes with a power adapter - use this to charge each motor before installation.

You can only pair the remotes or NEO smart hub with the blinds before you install them. You can pair with multiple remotes and the hub. Pairing with
a new remote or hub doesn't erase the old one. I've pair one blind with two remotes and the NEO hub. It worked with all of them.

If you have a popcorn ceiling, cover everything with cloths to avoid having to vacuum.

My narrower blinds (19" wide) had improperly placed battery holders: they were impeding the clips used to hold the motor in place. I had to reposition
them more to the middle of the blind header. I had to cut the zip tie holding the charging cable, remove the cable tie mount, remove the circuit board
from the battery holder, push out the battery, move the holder and replace everything. The circuit board and battery had to be removed so the side
the wires come out of could be switched. The battery is glued in but it's not too strong - should be easy to get out. If you have two people, one
should hold open the battery compartment and the other push the battery out with his/her finger.

It helped me to unpack everything, kit it all out, and throw away all the wrapping material before starting. I kept all my parts in ziploc bags
labeled with the window they belonged to.

If you don't have smooth walls on your skylights buy 1/8" - 1/4" weather stripping of appropriate color to light-seal the side rails. You may 
want to apply weather stripping anyway.

### Installation ###

The installation instructions are pretty good, but here's what I did.

First, ensure the motors are charged and pair the motors with every remote and smart hub you want to use with them.

Second, you have to install the solar panel. I had to extend the solar panel out by loosening the philips screw and sliding the top pieces out,
then screwing the screw tight again.
Measure 3" down from the window and 3" in on each side. Mount the right angle brackets that hold the solar panel with the provided self-tapping screws.
I only needed drywall anchors in one place, the others used the self-tapping screws just fine. The solar panel isn't heavy.

Cut the zip ties holding the wires for he solar panel and let the wire out. Push on the solar panel bracket and wedge it in to the right-angle bracket,
then let go of the brack and snap it into place.

Then, install the top brackets. I measured 3" in and 1 1/4" up from the bottom lip and used a preloaded punch to mark the location. This is the
bottom hole in the bracket - I then placed the bracket on top of the hole and marked the top hole with the punch. then I secured them with
the provided screws. Again, no anchors were needed. 

The motor clips onto the bracket in two places. First, on the bottom, the top/motor rail will clip into the bracket if you slip it between the wall and bracket.
When it's correctly installed you will not see the bracket below the top/motor rail. Then, push the top of the top/motor rail into the bracket until
it clips on top.

Attach the solar panel cord to the motor rail charging cord then 
After this, lower the blind with the remote until you are sure you can reach it from where you'll work on the bottom rail. It may not properly 
lower/extend but I had no issues fixing it with the remote after everything was installed. 

Install the bottom rail in the same manner as the top.

Next, find your side rails and prepare them. Make marks for screws 2" from each end and then every 12" within. Apply the weather stripping on the 
side of the rails which will be on the wall. Do it all the way along the rail - even where it's cut-out at the ends.

The side rails overlap the motor rails. The side of the rail with the removable color piece (I think it matches the color of your blinds?) is the one
that should be facing out.

Take both up and try to get one screw into each before you finish up. They should stay up with one screw.

Once they're up, you're done. Run them up and down a few times with the remote to work out the kinks.

## Long-Term Impressions ##

### 10/11/18 ###

Less than a week in, no issues with the solar panels. We've had overcast days so they're probably not charging well.
They've operated sufficiently so far. The bedroom ones we've opened and closed once per day.

No issues with the Neo Smart Hub app.
No issues with the remote.

They block out a sufficient amount of light. There's bleed-through at the motor rails on top (which could be fixed with the weather stripping) and
bleed-through on the sides where the accordion shutters don't quite make it all the way to the side of the rail. 

Neither is annoying so far, but I've been getting up before the sun.

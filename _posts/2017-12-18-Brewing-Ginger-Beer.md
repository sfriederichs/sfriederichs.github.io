I went to my company Christmas party the other night and ordered a cocktail. I asked for my go-to cocktail: whiskey and ginger ale. Turns out they made a mistake: they made me a whiskey and ginger *beer*. I am not one to waste alcohol so I drank it and my life was changed. I've heard the difference between ginger ale and ginger beer described thusly:

> Ginger ale is sweet with a side of ginger, ginger beer is ginger with a side of sweet.

The difference changed my life: I much prefered the bolder,spicier ginger taste of ginger beer vs. the ginger ale. I've resolved to brew up some of my own ginger beer at home. This isn't a far strecth: my wife has been fermenting with kefir grains for a while and I've been along for the ride so I have some background. FYI: This won't be alcoholic ginger beer, just *fermented* ginger beer. 

## Recipe ##

I've generated this recipe as an amalgamation of the various sources below.

### Ingredients ###

* 3/4 cup packed brown sugar (you can adjust to taste)
* 1 1/2 cups peeled and minced fresh ginger
* 2 quarts cold water, divided
* 2/3 cup freshly squeezed lime juice
* 1/4 teaspoon dried [champagne yeast](http://amzn.to/2zjUDVa)

### Directions ###

1. Mix sugar, ginger, and 4 cups water in saucepan. Bring to boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand 1 hour to steep.

2. Strain syrup through strainer and funnel into 2-liter soda bottle. Add lime juice. Fill with cold water to within 2 inches of top. Cap and cool in refrigerator or ice bath until about 65Â°F.

3. Add 1/4 teaspoon champagne yeast. (Reserve remaining yeast for next batch.) Cap bottle and let stand at room temperature for about 2 days, checking bottle pressure intermittently by squeezing it or releasing the cap slightly and briefly.

4. When ginger beer has achieved desired carbonation level, refrigerate. Serve and enjoy!

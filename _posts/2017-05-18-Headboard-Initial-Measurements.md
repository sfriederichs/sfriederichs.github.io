## Old Tasks#

Previous next steps:

* ~~Measure the bed frame to see how big the headboard needs to be~~
* ~~Figure out how to mount the headboard to the frame~~

## Bed Measurements##

At the bed frame where the headboard will attach, outside edge to outside edge is 61.5"

The distance between the bottom of the bed frame and the top of the mattress is 30"

## Headboard Mounting##

There are two parallel mounting holes on each side of the frame where I can bolt the headboard on to. The headboard might hit the wall, so I'd like
the head of the bolt to be flush with the piece of wood it's going through. That means I'll need to recess the holes for the bolts on the upright
supports for the headboard - and I should also leave room for some washers.

The wooden upright supports should probably extend below the bed frame so there's not undue stress on a cut end of the board. 

The headboard frame will probably sit against the wall, so I need some soft feet on the headboard frame so I don't damage the wall. They should be
non-marking as well. 

There are holes on the sides of the frame that may be able to provide some support. Tessa wants a bookshelf on this and if it sits too high we may
need cross-supports to prevent sagging. In that case I'd have to bolt something to the sides of the bed.

## New Ideas#

If there's books, then there should be a reading light. A nice, yellow-light dimmable reading light. LED strips? I'd need RGB LEDs and some means
to control the color and intensity. 

This would be an interesting opportunity to create an RGB LED driver. I've always wanted to control the temperature of the light produced by RGB 
LEDs to match the time of day: blue light in the morning to wake you up, yellow light as the day progresses to help you calm down and sleep.
It'd be like F.lux for RGB LEDs. That could be a product I could sell - design it to fit in an electrical box, but don't suggest that people put 
it inside a wall by any means. It's the same thing as that baby sleep LED bulb that Lighting Science makes. 

Also, it will lower the intensity of the light to help you get to sleep as time progresses. You just set a bed time and it dims the light and 
changes the spectrum as bed time approaches.

If it could be battery-powered and given a sticky backing so you could attach it anywhere then it would be more useful. Maybe it should have a 
motion sensor as well - then you could configure it like the smart in-wall dimmers. Could have different configurations: night light, wake-up
light when it sees you stirring in bed, typical light for a room where you walk in and it turns on.

If it were powerful enough then it could be the only light in a room. Maybe a fixture instead of a battery-powered stick light? Then you'd just need an easy way to configure it before you install it. The spectrum-changing functionality would be hard-coded based on time (which we could get
from several sources - account for daylight savings time? ). If it had a motion sensor and a light sensor then it would be complete: it wouldn't
need any settings. It would adjust its spectrum based on the time of day, only turn on when there's motion and insufficient light in the room.

Those LED light fixtures are just a circuit board. We can make a circuit board. We'd need someone who designs consumer electronics and can get
them certified from UL or whoever it needs, but I could do the initial design if it saves money. Then we'd pull in the certification guy and
a design for manufacture guy - maybe from China? I know people with contacts in China. 

This could be interesting.


## New Tasks#

* Determine what size bolts I need to fit the frame
* Determine what height the top of the headboard should be from the ground
* Make a rough sketch of the headboard with dimensions
* Find more examples of headboards with book shelves in them
* Figure out what drill bit I need to recess the bolt holes on the upright boards secured to the bed frame
* Find rubber feet to stick on the back of the headboard to protect the wall.
* Find the parts for LED reading lights and determine how much extra cost it will add
* Start collecting information and ideas for a time-of-day-based RGB LED controller

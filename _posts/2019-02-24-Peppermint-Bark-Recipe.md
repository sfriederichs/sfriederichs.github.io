## Background ##

When you live in a neighborhood, the holidays are a time of obligations. Did you know that you should give your neighbors gifts? Well, I decided that I'd use the opportunity to make a LOT of peppermint bark.
I love it, but the recipes make *pounds* of the stuff. That's a little much for me, but the leftover from a big batch for your neighbors is just enough for me.

Note: it takes like, 8 pounds of this stuff for a decently sized cul-de-sac.

## Recipe ##

### Ingredients ###

* 1 cup crushed candy canes
* 2 pounds white chocolate
* 2 tsp peppermint oil (to taste)

### Steps ###

1. Crush the candy canes to a size of 1/4" or so. I put them in a plastic bag and used a roller, but it destroyed the plastic bag.
2. Melt the chocolate in a double boiler.
3. Add the peppermint flavoring and crushed candy canes. Stir to mix, then pour into a cookie sheet. The size of the cookie sheet is up to you, some people like thicker bars some like thinner.
4. Put the sheets in the freezer to solidify.


## Notes ##

The peppermint oil really makes this recipe.

Use real white chocolate, not the fake 'vanilla' stuff they try to sell you.

## Conversions ##

* 8 Candy Canes = 1/2 cup 
* 24oz package of white chocolate chips is enough for one full batch plus 1/3 batch

So that'd be, with one 24 oz package of white chocolate chips:

* 24oz package white chocolate
* 12 Candy Canes
* 1 1/2 tsp peppermint oil

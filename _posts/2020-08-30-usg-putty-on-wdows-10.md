## Introduction ##

SSH is one of the best ways to interface to embedded systems. PuTTY is a Windows Telnet,SSH, etc. client. 
This guide will discuss how to install and use PuTTY on Windows 10.

## Download and Install ##

The main site for PuTTY is [here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/), and the download page is
[here](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html).  The latest version of PuTTY is .74 as
of the writing of this page. The installer for that is found [here](https://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/latest/w64/putty-64bit-0.74-installer.msi).
' I selected the 64-bit version.

I double-clicked the installer and followed these instructions to install it:

1. On the first screen, I clicked 'Next'
2. On the second page, the default installation directory is acceptable, so I click 'Next'
3. On the Product Features page I added the 'Add shortcut to PuTTY on the Desktop' option and clicked 'Install'
4. A UAC prompt shows up and I allow it.
5. The installation takes very little time and then wants me to read the README before I exit. I avoid this and
click 'Finish'

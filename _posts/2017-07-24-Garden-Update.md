We've had a lot of rain and overcast days this week, so very little watering was needed.

## Garden Log##

#### Container 1

It's worth noting that this container seems to have something wrong with its weed cloth. Whenever the water runs out it's brown - full of dirt it looks like. I'm assuming it won't be a problem before we take that container apart and plant something new in it.

* Bush beans - They look better now, but the beans themselves are starting to yellow. I should really pluck them all even if I'm not going to eat them. I've read some people say that the plants really take off when you harvest
* Flowers - They're everywhere! And gorgeous I suppose, but still. It's supposed to be a vegetable garden, not a flower garden. I don't have the heart to tear them out.
* Ginger - I hope this is growing underground because it's not nearly as exciting above ground as the turmeric.

#### Container 2

Still lots of leaf growth, but sadly the one flower was blown off in the wind. Curiously, I'm not seeing new flowers. Maybe it's too hot for it? Also, some of the new leaves are immediately withering which is strange.

#### Container 3

This container is currently shaded. 

* Parsley - This is getting much more leafy!

* Big pepper plant - It's a mixed bag. I've noticed that the leaves outside of the shade look much rougher than those inside the shade. There's new growth under the shade and potentially new blooms. The current peppers are not growing quickly if at all and I'm starting to see signs of them ripening. Oh well. This is the hottest part of the summer, so I suppose it's to be expected. Maybe some pruning will help it.
* Pepper sprouts - None have sprouted yet despite sacrificing more peppers to the effort. It'd be nice if they did but I'm not holding my breath.
* Turmeric - Still big, still healthy.


## Fruit Trees##

### Papaya ###

It is not dead yet!

### Avocado ###

I'm trying to grow an avocado tree from a pit. Right now I'm keeping the pits in water to get them to sprout, then I'll transfer them to a pot. I've been told this is unnecessary: the pot works just fine. Oh well.

## Plan ##

#### Container 1

Pick the beans. Maybe remove a flower

#### Container 2

Patience: the eggplants will come.

#### Container 3

Prune the pepper plants if I'm brave enough.

#### Container 4 - Planned

Possible options:

* Yellow squash 
* Cherry tomatoes
* Okra
* Southern Peas
* Sweet potatoes

I'm leaning toward cherry tomatoes at the moment.

#### Fall/Winter

We'd like the following plants:

* Garlic
* Onion
* Green onion
* Spinach
* Kale
* More greens
* Carrots
* Broccoli

I'd like at least 6 containers by October 1st. 

#### Fruit Trees

We want the following fruit trees:

* Avocado
* Mango
* Lime

## Introduction ##

In my time being an employee I've noticed good business practices that I wish to emulate. I'm collecting all of the good ideas I think or find here.

## Best Practices ##

### Monthly Charity ###

Any petty money collected in the office or business (say, from vending machines) should be donated to a charity. 
The charity should be changed - perhaps monthly. The charity should be prominently displayed on your website and in
the workplace.

Methods for collecting money:

* Vending machines
* Employee opt-in donations on paycheck or collection
* Special sales of snacks, etc. We had someone who made good cupcakes bring a batch for charity in once in a while


### Open Source Support ###

Yearly donations should be made to open source projects that the company benefits from.

It's time to try to plant a garden for this year. 

Unfortunately, I did not get a community garden plot this year and I have no room for beds in my back yard.

So, I've made what I call 'ladder planters' and self-watering 5 gallon bucket planter.

The ladder planters have two 3 ft planters. The top planter has access to a trellis to support viney things.

The bottom does not.

I need to figure out, with the plants that I have, which plants I can plant where. 

# Plant List #

* Sweet tomatoes
* Beefsteak tomatoes 
* Spinach
* Zuchinni
* Cucumber
* Green Beans
* Yellow squash
* Bell Pepper
* Kale
* Lettuce
* White onion
* Radishes

# Ladder Planter Needs #

The zuchinni, green beans and cucumber need their own planter each - that's three planters.  The yellow squash? Give it one of its own - four total now, with only the upper half occupied.

| Planter #	| Sun			| Upper Veggies				| Lower Veggies				|
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
|  1		| Full			| Zuchinni					|                           |
|  2		| Full			| Green Beans               |                   |
|  3		| Full			| Yellow Squash				| White onion               |
|  4		| Full			| Cucumber					|                           |
|  5		| Shade			| Kale, Radishes    		| Spinach, Lettuce          |

# Materials #

I've got two already.
I need five. 

The shade one shouldn't have wire on it.

I need to modify the two that I have to only have one shelf.

then I need two more just like it:

4x 6" - 5 ft
4x 4" - 3 ft

Then, one like this:

2x 6" - 5ft
4x 4" - 3 ft


Total of 6x 6" - 5 ft - 3x 10 ft 6"
8x 4" - 3ft - 2x 12 ft 4"

and currently I have 8x of the planters. Looks like that's all I need.

And as for soil, it's like 6" deep, 3ft long, 6" deep = .75 cu ft per each planter times 8 is 6 cu ft = 44 gallons

roughly 50 gallons

I need soil, peat, manure and vermiculite in equal portions

Roughly 12 gallons each - or 1.6 cu ft

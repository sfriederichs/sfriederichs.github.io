This article describes how to remove scratches from a car's windshield.

## Background ##

My car's windshield has a lot of fine scratches on it - apparently from my windshield wipers. This causes
some issues at night with lights - the scratches cause distracting patterns on the windshield.

Apparently these scratches can be fixed with a mild abrasive called cerium oxide. It's cheap enough in
bulk on places like amazon, but you need a polishing wheel kit that fits on a standard drill.

In my experience, it is best to use a corded drill for this process. A cordless tends to lose its charge very quickly.

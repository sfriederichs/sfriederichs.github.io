It's time for a new project!

We've been talking about home improvement projects lately and my wife suggested that I make a headboard for the queen bed in our spare bedroom.
We bought the mattress when we moved into our house and never bought a fancy bed frame. They're so expensive anyway - did you know the markup
on furniture is at least 3x? Plus, I have basic to semi-advanced woodworking skills, a workshop, a collection of tools and a Lowes credit card,
so why not?

Theoretically, a headboard shouldn't be too difficult - especially if I don't try to make complex decorations or dress it up too much. To that end,
I need ideas. I must make a confession about this: I get my best ideas from Pintrest. I try to hate all kinds of social media, but Pintrest is an
ideal place to get a lot of DIY ideas quickly. I'd hate myself if it weren't so great. Take a 
[https://www.pinterest.com/sfriederich0604/headboards/](look) at the board I made for ideas. People are saying they can do it for $40. That's pretty cheap. I'm going to give it a try.

Next step: measuring the bed frame to see how big this needs to be and figuring out how to mount it to the frame.

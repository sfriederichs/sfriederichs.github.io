The ice maker on our refrigerator fills slowly. I don't think we use that much ice and in any case it used to fill fill no problem. Something is amiss.

The refrigerator model is an Electrolux FGHB2866PF2 which is apparently branded as a Frigidaire. I believe we got this one at Home Depot.

## Possibilities##

1. Is the water on?
2. Poor water pressure - check your filter, check the pressure from the wall, etc.
2. Needs to be defrosted - apparently this may need to be done every few months? There is supposed to be a defrost cycle but a design flaw causes the drain to ice up and renders it useless. There's an updated insulation kit that is supposed to address this issue.

## Complaining ##

Complaining should always be your first step in getting things fixed. It works wonders. Be persistent. In this case, I emailed Frigidaire customer support requesting the updated insulation kit and professional installation - for free of course. We'll see what they do with that. In the mean time, I'll investigate the ice maker for ice buildup and defrost it.

## Defrosting the Icemaker ##

This process involves removing the icemaker so that the ice buildup behind the unit can be removed and icemaker performance increased.

This article serves as a guide for maintaining the water chemistry in a hot tub and general maintenance of the hot tub.

## Daily/After Use ##

## Every Other Day ##

### Testing Water Chemistry ###

Testing for water chemistry should be done every other day or so. Here's how.

(This)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00107039U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00107039U/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1] is the test kit I use.

1. Get the test kit
2. Fill the big and little water reservoirs to their respective lines.
3. Put 5 drops of solution #1 (yellow/chlorine test) into the small water reservoirs\
4. Put 1 drop solution 4 into the big water reservoirs
5. Put the caps on the reservoirs and shake them
6. Add 5 drops solution 3 (ph Test) to the large water reservoirs
7. 

## Every 4-8 Weeks ##

### Draining, Cleaning and Refilling the Hot Tub ###

Despite best efforts at maintaining the water chemistry and filtering out solids, it's a reality that they
will accumulate in the hot tub water. Draining the hot tub is usually an effort to reduce the amount of dissolved solids in the hot tub water. It is not an effort to remove every single drop of water from the
hot tub and its plumbing. At best, it is an effort to remove all the water from the sitting area of the tub to reduce dissolved solids and allow for cleaning of the hot tub.

This process is generally done every month or so depending on need. When we first set up our hot tub we had to drain and refill it within four weeks or so because of sticker gunk, errors in maintaining the water chemistry,
etc. 

Steps to drain and refill the hot tub are discussed below.

#### Degreasing the Filters ####

About 24-32 hours before you want to have the hot tub refilled, you should begin degreasing the filters. Follow these steps:

1. Get a 5 gallon bucket to put the filters in 
2. Turn off power to the hot tub at the breaker
3. Unscrew each filter and put them in the bucket.
4. Rinse the large debris out of the filters - no need to be too thorough as you'll be doing a much more thorough job after they soak.
5. Remove the filters from the bucket and fill a quarter of the way full with hot water.
6. Add in one cup of TSP and stir to mix.
7. Put in both filters and then fill the bucket the rest of the way with hot water - at least until the filters are submerged
8. Put something heavy on top of the filters to keep them submerged
9. Leave them soak overnight
10. Int he morning, dump the water and thoroughly clean in between each of the folds on the filter
11. Thoroughly rinse out the bucket to remove all TSP residue
12. Fill the bucket with enough cold water to submerge the filters and leave them there until it's time to put them back in the hot tub.

#### Drain and refill ####

Start this as soon as possible in the morning - if you don't get it started before 10AM you're screwed.

1. Turn off power to the hot tub at the breaker
2. Lay out a hose from the hot tub (female end), out the gate to the street (male end). Make sure all of the kinks are out of the hose to help it drain
3. Pull out the drain hose from the hot tub - it's in the northeast corner.
4. Remove the cap and put it in a SAFE location you won't forget about and attach the female end of the hose to the drain hose
5. Twist the drain hose to open it. 
6. The hot tub will probably be fully drained by mid-afternoon or so. At that point, use a wet/dry vac to remove the standing water in the hot tub.
7. Use a magic eraser all over the hot tub surface paying particular attention to the water line and any problem areas
8. Towel off the hot tub surface with a damp microfiber cloth
9. Wet a dry microfiber cloth with rubbing alcohol and wipe all areas of the hot tub.
10. Turn on your filling hose and let it run for 60s to get debris out of the line
11. Attach your filling filter and let it run for 60s to run any particulates out of the line
12. Fill the hot tub through the filter holes - fill it partway through one and then switch to make sure they're both covered
13. Once full, put the filters back in.
14. Turn on the breakers to the hot tub and start a purge cycle
15. When the purge cycle is complete, set your desired temperature and change the hot tob to 'READY' mode instead of 'READY/REST' mode. This will cause it to heat faster.
16. Test the water for pH when done filling and add acid/base as necessary (water in Littleton is usually rather basic to start)
17. Add serum and chlorine on your usual day. 

## Handling Issues ##

These are common issues you'll have with the hot tub - as well as how to fix them.

### Foaming Water ###

Might be too high alkalinity. Or it might be general scum. The last time it was general scum Cathryn got an eye infection. I don't recommend. 

Keep filters clean.

Use 1.5 oz of serum per week (11 squirts).

Keep pH balanced.

Make sure you add one tbsp of non-chlorine shock per person every time the hot tub is used. Shock significantly reduces foaminess/

### Cloudy Water ###

This is either fixed by serum or a significant chlorine shock. 

If it's Serum, you can't use any more, so don't worry about it.

Actually, I'm almost certain that it's caused by a combination of acidity and possible low chlorine.

If your combined chlorine level is higher than your free chlorine and your water is acidic, balancing the pH may clear up cloudiness without superchlorination. Add baking soda first, then observe the change in water.

Keeping up with shock will also help cloudy water.

### Low pH (Acidic) ###

Low pH is bad because chlorine bound up to hydrogen to make HCl can't be DOING ITS DAMN JOB SANITIZING MY WATER. Thus, if you have high pH, you chlorine might not be very effective.

Additionally, chlorine turns the water acidic which is not great for your equipment.

Oddly enough, baking soda is pH up. 1.25 tablespoons per .4 pH up per 300 gallons of water is my usage. 

I may be wrong. God rest my soul if I am.

It's worth noting that skin irritation seems less when the tub is acidic.

### High pH (Alkaline) ###

For this, you'd need pH Down, i.e., acid.
Acid is added by the capful - I've never added more than one at a time.


## Chemicals ##

These are the chemicals I use:

* (ph Down - Acid)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MHSL4W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1] - This is a granular acid that can be stored in the cabinet outside
* (ph Up - Base)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V89QRY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1] - It turns out this stuff is just baking soda
* (Non-Chlorine Shock)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZS9T8X8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1] - This will destroy organic molecules without incerasing the Cl2
* (TSP - Degreaser)[https://www.amazon.com/Sunnyside-Corporation-699-852-Trisodium-Phosphate/dp/B0098WFGXC/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=tsp&qid=1556394863&s=gateway&sr=8-2] - This is used to degrease the filters when draining the hot tub
* (Serum)[https://www.amazon.com/Hot-Tub-Serum-Maintenance-Conditioner/dp/B00SFZOABC/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=hot+tub+serum&qid=1556394901&s=gateway&sr=8-3] - I'm still not entirely sure what this stuff *does* but everyone seems to use either this or the orange stuff
* (Silk Balance)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJZO9MQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1} - Could probably be used instead of the serum
* (Dichlor)[https://www.amazon.com/SpaChoice-472-3-5081-Chlorine-Granules-5-Pound/dp/B00AYJ0XK4/ref=sr_1_10?keywords=hot+tub+dichlor&qid=1556395025&s=gateway&sr=8-10] - Chlorine granules. Sanitizer/shock
